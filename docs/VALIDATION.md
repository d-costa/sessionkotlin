# Global Type Validation

- In a choice branch, a role can be enabled or disabled.
- The choice target is the only enabled role at the start.
- Only enabled roles can initiate an interaction.
- Roles that receive messages become enabled.
- For every role that is not the choice target, the peer of the enabling action must be the same in all cases.
